## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd employee-directory
   ```

2. **Open the application**:

   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - No server setup required - runs entirely in the browser

3. **Alternative: Use a local server** (recommended for development):

   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server

   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (if using a server)
   - Or open `index.html` directly in your browser
